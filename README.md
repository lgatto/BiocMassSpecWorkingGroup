# Bioconductor Mass Spectrometry Working Group

**Who**: Initiated by Laurent Gatto (TAB) and Johannes Rainer (CAB)

**Goals**: The goal of this working group is to identify members of the Bioconductor community that are interested and/or active in the area of mass spectrometry, proteomics and/or metabolomics and define technical needs or community expectations to prioritise future developments. More specifically, we suggest the following steps.

- Reference relevant MS/proteomics/metabolomics packages in Bioconductor and their dependencies. Are there sets of packages that interoperate? Are there many packages that perform very similar or identical tasks? Is there scope for better interoperability?
- List active MS/proteomics/metabolomics maintainers/users and invite them to join the working group. 
- Identify missing features and/or areas that the working group could focus on. 
- Promote the usage of the #mass-spectrometry, #proteomics and #metabolomics channels on slack with the aim to organise regular (open) meetings and/or dedicated workshops.
